random seeds, limits of rules.

*a 4x4 polyrythmic sequencer inspired by the moog subharmonicon*

4 columns run in various directions (E2) and at individual speeds (E3)
a matrix of 16 randomly seeded notes where each row has a push sequencer with individual speed (E2) and direction (E3)
navigate the columns/rows with E1.
as a side dish octave offset (left) and octave range (right) can be altered for the individual rows with K3 + E2 (left) / E3 (right)
params are there.

lot's of work to do but it's working and (i hope) stable for basic navigation.
