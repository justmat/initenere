### Documentation
At startup a random seed of 4x4 notes are generated, these can be re-seeded in params.

The screen has eight edit positions. Navigate with E1.

**Horizontally** 1-4 selects four separate rows of sequencers. These trigger notes and move in one of three ways. Edit with E2.
`>` forward
`<` backward
`~` random
`-` halt movement

E3 alters time from 1x to 16x (16 is faster).

K3 (hold) enables alt-edit.

`o -3 to 3` Sequenced notes octave offset (edit with K3+E2)
`1, 3 and 5 o` Sequenced notes octave range (edit with K3+E3)

**Vertically** there are four sequencers with their own individual direction and speed (same instructions as above E2 = direction and E3 = time).
